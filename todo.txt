        **Get a timer working to record length of the fishing session
            Setup way to record gear 
            Really should be a prompt to walk you through setting up your gear for that trip after you hit lets fish.
                Should be able to select presets

MVP
    Watch app that allows you to record information about a fish and creates a timestamp and new fish entry
    Page to upload photos to your fishing sessionas


MAKE THIS WHOLE THING A WEB APP
[] when you catch a fish and add a lure, you should add to a whole big list that allows you to then filter when you're typing in a lure the next time

Mobile app that literally just does the tracking. 

Then a web app that allows you to look at all the data.


So that when you catch a fish it can grab data from that.
