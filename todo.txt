TODO:

    Finish mobile.
            Setup way to record gear 
            Really should be a prompt to walk you through setting up your gear for that trip after you hit lets fish.
                Should be able to select presets

    watch and camera function completely apart from the phone web app

    Watch:
        - gets audio clip
        - takes a timestamp of when you take that audio clip

    Camera:
        - Takes picture of fish
        - Gets metadata for that image and also gets a timestamp for when that picture is taken

    Picture should be taken first, voice clip after

    Match audio clip timestamp to the photo timestamp

    Need to figure out how to parse audio clip and get gps location based off of the information that I have

UPLOAD:
    Add abililty to delete photos once you've selected them

Dashboard
    Style this jawn
    Need to add data for each session that you've got

Mobile
    get weather data for a fishing session
        beginning and end temps and then average

    provide prompt to pick which creek you're fishing
    Should have a way when you start the app to setup your gear you're using.

MVP
    Watch app that allows you to record information about a fish and creates a timestamp and new fish entry
    Page to upload photos to your fishing sessionas


MAKE THIS WHOLE THING A WEB APP
[] when you catch a fish and add a lure, you should add to a whole big list that allows you to then filter when you're typing in a lure the next time

Mobile app that literally just does the tracking. 

Then a web app that allows you to look at all the data.


So that when you catch a fish it can grab data from that.
