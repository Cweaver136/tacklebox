[] get weather data for a fishing session
    [] beginning and end temps and then average

    [] provide prompt to pick which creek you're fishing
    
    [] session should merge if there are more than one on a given day
        [] merge total time
        [] merge fish caught

MAKE THIS WHOLE THING A WEB APP
[] when you catch a fish and add a lure, you should add to a whole big list that allows you to then filter when you're typing in a lure the next time

Mobile app that literally just does the tracking. 

Then a web app that allows you to look at all the data.
